// This configuration file sets up Jest for testing a Node.js backend.
// It specifies the test environment, file patterns for tests, and coverage settings.
// The coverage thresholds ensure that the code quality remains high, especially for critical files like sentimentService.js.
// The configuration is designed to work seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, such as Jenkins, to enforce code quality standards.
// Keeps your current test setup
// Adds a global minimum of 80% coverage for everything
// Enforces 90% coverage for sentimentService.js specifically
// Causes Jest (and therefore Jenkins) to fail the build if thresholds arenâ€™t met
